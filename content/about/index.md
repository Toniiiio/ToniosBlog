My name is Tonio. I enjoy programming in R, especially working on the interface of webservers and R(Studio). Besides programming I love playing squash and road racing with my bike. I dream of bringing my paragliding licence to good use one day and spend my after works in the air.

I graduated with a M.Sc. in quant. finance. Prior to working as a data scientist in Frankfurt I gained experience as a data analytics consultant and founded an analytics startup. 
I am always happy to get messages from within the R / data science community.
